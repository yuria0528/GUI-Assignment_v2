Smile & Sunshine - jQuery + HTML prototype (Order System)

How to run:
1. Place all files in same folder preserving directories (assets/, data/).
2. Open index.html in your browser (no server required).
3. Use demo accounts from data/USERS.TXT to login:
   - alice@example.com / Password123! (customer)
   - sales1@sstoys.com / SalesPass789! (sales)
4. Test flows:
   - Catalog -> Customize -> Add to Wishlist -> Wishlist -> Submit Request
   - Login as sales -> Sales Dashboard -> update order status

Notes:
- This is a front-end prototype using localStorage to simulate persistence.
- For final submission, include screenshots for system documentation and USERS.TXT file.
